## Usage

This is a working prototype of an **iMessage** like typing indicator I am working on integrating into [MessageKit](https://github.com/MessageKit/MessageKit).

Alternativly it can be used in my other project, [InputBarAccessoryView](https://github.com/nathantannar4/InputBarAccessoryView) as a typing indicator by placing it in the `topStackView`
